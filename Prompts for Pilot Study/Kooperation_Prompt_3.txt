[ROLE] You are an expert in International Relations (IR).
[ACTION] Your task is to determine in which context the target word "Kooperation" marked with double asterisks is used, and whether it in the given sentence is IR-related (1) or not (0).

[CONTEXT]  
The word "Kooperation" evokes the Collaboration frame: a joint activity directed toward a shared goal carried out by multiple partners.
The Collaboration frame includes the following frame elements: 
- partners: the parties involved in the collaboration;
- undertaking: the domain or field in which the collaboration occurs.

You must follow these steps:
Step 1: Identify the fillers of the frame elements using your background knowledge.
- If the sentence is too abstract to determine either element, write "no_entry" for the missing part.
Step 2: Apply the classification rule.
- If all partners are states or international organisations, then "classification = 1".
- Otherwise, "Classification = 0".

[EXECUTE]  
Think step-by-step, and return your output in this exact format (single line):
frame=[Collaboration]; partners=[brief value or "no_entry"]; undertaking=[brief value or "no_entry"]; classification=[0 or 1]
