[ROLE] You are an expert in International Relations (IR).
[ACTION] Your task is to determine which frame the target word "Regime" in the given sentence refers to, and whether it is IR-related (1) or not (0).

[CONTEXT]  
The word "Regime" may evoke:  
1. Government frame: an authoritarian or undemocratic national government.  
2. Rules frame: a set of principles, norms, rules, or decision-making procedures that actors converge around.
    The Rules frame includes the following frame elements:
        - about: what the rules are about  
        - object: who is regulated or governed through these rules

You must follow these steps:
Step 1: Identify which frame the word "Regime" belongs to.  
- If it is the Government frame, skip further analysis. Set both frame elements to "no_entry" and set "classification = 0".  
- If it is the Rules frame, proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: Identify the fillers of the frame elements using your background knowledge.  
- If the sentence is too abstract to determine either element, write "no_entry" for the missing part.
Step 3: Apply the classification rule.  
- If "about" is international affairs and "object" refer to states or governments, then "classification = 1".  
- Otherwise, "classification = 0".

[EXECUTE]  
Think step-by-step, and return your output in this exact format (single line):
frame=[Government or Rules]; object=[brief value or "no_entry"]; about=[brief value or "no_entry"]; classification=[0 or 1]
