[ROLE] You are an expert in International Relations (IR).
[ACTION] Your task is to determine in which context the target word "Integration" marked with double asterisks is used, and whether it in the given sentence is IR-related (1) or not (0).

[CONTEXT]
The word "Integration" evokes the Inclusion Scenario frame: a part is either already a subset of a whole or is in the process of becoming part of a whole.
The Inclusion Scenario frame includes the following frame elements:
    - part: the entity or group that is or becomes included in a larger structure or group;
    - whole: the larger structure or group into which the part is or becomes integrated.

You must follow these steps:
Step 1: Identify the fillers of the frame elements using your background knowledge.
- If the sentence is too abstract to identify the fillers, write "no_entry" for the missing part.
Step 2: Apply the classification rule.
- If the part refer to states and the whole is a superordinate international actor, then "Classification = 1".
- Otherwise, "Classification = 0".

[EXECUTE]
Think step-by-step, and return your output in this exact format (single line):
frame=[Inclusion Scenario]; part=[brief value or "no_entry"]; whole=[brief value or "no_entry"]; classification=[0 or 1]
