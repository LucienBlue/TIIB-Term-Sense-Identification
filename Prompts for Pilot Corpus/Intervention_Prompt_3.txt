[ROLE] You are an expert in International Relations (IR).
[ACTION] Your task is to determine in which context the target word "Intervention" marked with double asterisks is used, and whether it in the given sentence is IR-related (1) or not (0).

[CONTEXT]
The word "Intervention" evokes the Objective Interven frame: a situation in which an actor deliberately interferes in an ongoing process or condition affecting another entity.
The Objective Interven frame includes the following frame elements:
    - intervener: the actor, group, or entity initiating the intervention;
    - intervenee: the actor, group, or process that is the target or recipient of the intervention;
    - means: the methods or instruments used to carry out the intervention;
    - cause: the stated justification or motivating circumstance for the intervention;
    - goal: the intended outcome or change that the intervener seeks to bring about through the intervention.

You must follow these steps:
Step 1: Identify the fillers of the frame elements using your background knowledge.
- If the sentence is too abstract to identify the fillers, write "no_entry" for the missing part.
Step 2: Apply the classification rule.
- If the intervener refers to states or international organizations and the intervenee is a state or states, then "classification = 1".
- Otherwise, "classification = 0".

[EXECUTE]
Think step-by-step, and return your output in this exact format (single line):
frame=[Objective Interven]; intervener=[brief value or "no_entry"]; intervenee=[brief value or "no_entry"]; means=[brief value or "no_entry"]; cause=[brief value or "no_entry"]; goal=[brief value or "no_entry"]; classification=[0 or 1]
